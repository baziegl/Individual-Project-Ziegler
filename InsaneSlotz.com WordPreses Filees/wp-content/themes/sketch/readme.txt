Sketch takes advantage of the Portfolio feature in Jetpack (http://jetpack.me), offering unique layouts and organization for your portfolio projects. Learn how to enable and set up this exciting Portfolio feature: http://en.support.wordpress.com/portfolios/

Once you create a project, you can use the portfolio shortcode to display it anywhere on your site. Adding the [portfolio] shortcode to any post or page will insert your project.

Learn more about working with the portfolio shortcode: http://en.support.wordpress.com/portfolios/portfolio-shortcode/

## Portfolio Page Template ##

This template will display your portfolio and allow you to set your portfolio as your site’s front page.

When you first activate Sketch, you’ll see your posts in a traditional blog format. If you’d like to use the portfolio page template as the front page of your site, it’s simple to configure:

1. Create or edit a page, and assign it to the Portfolio Page Template from the Page Attributes module.
2. Go to Settings → Reading and set “Front page displays” to “A static page”.
3. Select the page you just assigned the Portfolio Page Template to as “Front page” and set another page as the “Posts page” to display your blog posts.

## Where is the portfolio archive page? ##

Along with the Portfolio Page Template, your projects will be displayed on portfolio archive pages.

If your blog’s URL is http://example.com/, you’ll find your portfolio archive page at http://example.com/portfolio/.

If you’d like to add your portfolio archive page to your a Custom Menu, create a custom link using the portfolio archive URL.

== How can I add a site logo? ==

Brand your site and make it yours by including your business' logo; navigate to Customize → Site Title and upload a logo image in the space provided. The logo will appear next to your site title in the header; it can be any size, but will display at a maximum height of 100 px.

== How can I add links to my social networks? ==

You can add links to a multitude of social services in the footer, using the following steps:

1. Create a new Custom Menu, and assign it to the Social Links menu location.
2. Add links to each of your social services using the Links panel.
3. Icons for your social links will appear in the footer.
